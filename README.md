# 🎓 Student Performance Dashboard – Power BI

An interactive dashboard developed using **Power BI**, based on a Kaggle dataset to analyze various factors influencing student academic performance.

## 📌 Project Overview

Understanding student performance is essential to identify learning gaps and improve education strategies. This dashboard offers insights into how gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect student outcomes.

## 📊 Key Insights & Inferences

- **Gender & Subject Performance**:  
  Female students show slightly higher average scores across all subjects compared to males.

- **Lunch Type & Performance**:  
  64% of students have a standard lunch and generally score higher than those receiving free/reduced lunch, indicating that proper nutrition may influence academic success.

- **Parental Education Influence**:  
  Students whose parents hold a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree perform better, emphasizing the role of family education background in student achievement.

- **Test Preparation Impact**:  
  Students who completed test preparation courses scored significantly higher, highlighting the benefit of structured learning programs.

- **Performance by Age**:  
  A noticeable dip in average scores is observed around age 16, likely due to academic pressure. Scores tend to stabilize as students grow older.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This dashboard provides meaningful, data-driven insights into student performance and helps identify key areas to focus on for educational improvement.
